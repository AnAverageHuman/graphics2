Awkward Valentine Edition

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Requires GNU AWK, the default AWK on most Linux systems that have it.
Requires `rm' for removal of the output file only.

Requires a LaTeX compiler to generate the PDF in algorithm/.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:
$ make
Alternatively, one can run the script directly:
$ gawk -f main.awk
or
$ ./main.awk

One can change the output file by declaring $OUTFILE like so:
$ OUTFILE=filename make
or
$ make OUTFILE=filename
If directly running the script:
$ gawk -f main.awk > filename
or
$ ./main.awk > filename

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Everything is hard-coded. As such, the picture will not scale properly. There
really is nothing configurable in config.awk, but one can try.

Attempting to draw vertical or horizontal lines will cause issues. Don't do it.
